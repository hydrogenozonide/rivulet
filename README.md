# Rivulet
An extremely extremely EXTREMELY work-in-progress desktop shell for Niri, written in Quickshell.
This is also my first time using quickshell so I'm just playing around for the first couple tens of commits.

# THIS IS NOT YET IN A USABLE STATE!
I Highly recommend NOT installing anything from this repo. The code's bad, it all barely works at the best of times, there'll be multiple breaking changes a day.

# TODO
- [x] ~~Basic sidebar function~~
- [x] ~~Basic panel functionality~~
- [ ] System widgets in panel
- [ ] Launcher/Dmenu
- [ ] Control panel, android style
- [ ] Nice wallpaper grid
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Notifications in panel
- [ ] Material 3 design style
- [ ] Matugen colours
- [ ] Make the whole thing look less crappy
- [ ] Make it actually GOOD?

# Credits
- It's not implemented yet, but I'll be using [QML Material](https://github.com/hypengw/QmlMaterial/) for most of the visuals as graphics are definitely not my strong suit.
- [Caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) served as a lot of inspiration for actually doing this whole thing, and the layout of the sidebar. I haven't actually read any of their code though.
- A hell of a lot of [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) for inspiration.
