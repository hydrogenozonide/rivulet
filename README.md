# Rivulet
An extremely extremely EXTREMELY work-in-progress desktop shell for Niri, written in Quickshell.
This is also my first time using quickshell so I'm just playing around for the first couple tens of commits.

# THIS IS NOT YET IN A USABLE STATE!
I Highly recommend NOT installing anything from this repo. The code's bad, it all barely works at the best of times, there'll be multiple breaking changes a day.

# TODO
